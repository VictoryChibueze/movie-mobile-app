# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

As a software engineer focused on improving my mobile development skills, I created this movie app to explore the full workflow of building a cross-platform application with React Native. This project allowed me to strengthen my understanding of mobile UI design, REST API integration, navigation systems, and performance optimization.
The movie app lets users browse a collection of movies, view detailed information about each film, and search for specific titles. Users can also explore trending or popular films and navigate through different categories with ease. The interface is designed to be simple and visually engaging, providing an intuitive user experience on both Android and iOS devices.

My purpose in building this app was to gain practical experience working with APIs, managing application state, and designing a responsive UI—all while building something fun and useful.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

•	React Native – Framework used for building the mobile application.
•	Visual Studio Code – Primary code editor.
•	Android Studio – Used to run and test the app on Android Emulator.
•	Expo CLI – Used to streamline the development, testing, and deployment process.


•	JavaScript – Core programming language for the app.
